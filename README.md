thebiggame is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle that drives [theBIGGAME](https://thebiggame.org)'s live graphics. 

# How to Use

This project still uses the old Bower package manager for client side dependencies.

Install Bower and NPM, then run `bower install` and `npm install` from the root.

You should then be able to do `npx nodecg start` (this bundle supports the new NodeCG instantiation method).
